     <h2>Tacos Al Pastor</h2>
        <p>Tacos al pastor were created in the 1930s in Puebla, Mexico, by Lebanese immigrants 
            who introduced the region to classic shawarma: roast lamb served on a flour tortilla 
            or pita bread (pan árabe). This creation was originally known as tacos árabes, and 
            used meat cooked on a vertical, or upright, grill.</p>

        <p>When the upright grill moved on from Puebla, the tacos al pastor as we know it today 
            gradually came into being: Marinated pork replaced lamb on the spit, and cilantro 
            and onions were added to the mix.</p>

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 lb boneless pork shoulder</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons achiote paste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons guajillo chili powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pepper</li>
                <li><small>3/4</small> cup white vinegar</li>
                <li>1 cup pineapple juice</li>
                <li>1 pineapple, skinned and sliced into 1-inch (2 cm) rounds</li>
            </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice the pork shoulder into about 1-centimeter (¼ in) slices, then transfer 
                    to a large dish or bowl. In a medium bowl, combine the achiote paste, chili powder, 
                    garlic powder, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper, vinegar, and pineapple juice, 
                    mashing and stirring until smooth with no lumps. Pour the marinade over the pork slices, 
                    then toss to make sure they are coated on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, 
                    then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.</li>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum
                     foil.</li>

                <li>Place a slice or two of the pineapple on the baking sheet. Take a wooden skewer and push 
                    it directly in the middle of the pineapple. Remove the pork from the fridge and push the 
                    slices through the skewer, layering one after the other until there is a 1-inch (2 ½ cm) gap 
                    at the top. Push another pineapple slice on top.</li>

                <li>Bake for about 1½ hours, until the pork is slightly charred on the outside and deep red. 
                    Rest the meat for about 10 minutes, then carve off thin slices of pork and roasted pineapple.</li>

                <li>To assemble, place some pork on the tortillas, followed by a few pieces of pineapple, a 
                    sprinkling of onion, a pinch of cilantro, and a spoonful of salsa, and some diced avocado. 
                    Serve with lime wedges.</li>
            </ol>
